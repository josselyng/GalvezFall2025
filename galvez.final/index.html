                <h3 class="headings">About</h3>
                <p>There is a lot of mixed opinions of sunscreen and it isn't until recently, society has seen an
                    importance
                    with using it. You either know someone who is crazy about sunscreen and smear it on every day and
                    night,
                    or the person who has never purchased one in their lives.</p>

                <p> Also known as sunblock, sun lotion or sun
                    cream, sunscreen is a photoprotective topical product that helps protect our skin from sunburn and
                    prevent skin cancer. Sunscreens come as lotions, sprays, gel, powder, sticks, and foam. Active
                    ingredients like zinc oxide, homoslate, titanium dioxide, and more are protecting your skin from the
                    sun's UV rays. Depending on the ingredients, there are two types of sunscreen, mineral or chemical
                    sunscreen.
                </p>

                <h3 class="headings">Benefits</h3>
                <p> Sunscreen's only purpose is to protect the skin from UV rays therefore, it can help prevent skin
                    cancers like, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. A study from 2013 showed that the application of
                    suncreen everyday, can slow or temporarily prevent wrinkles and sagging skin. This study involved
                    900 white people in Australia and had them apply sunscreen everyday for four and a half years. The
                    people that followed through had more smoother and elastic skin than the ones who didn't follow
                    through. 32 of these subjects also showed the daily use of sunscreen reversed premature aging.
                    Sunscreen can improve the skin's appearance and texture. </p>

                <h3 class="blackfont">UVA AND UVB</h3>
                <p class="blackfont">To better understand what sunscreens really do, let's talk about the actual UV rays
                    and how much
                    damage they can really do. UVA and UVB are two types of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UVA
                    rays have a longer wavelength which means it penetrates deeper into the skin and is associated with
                    premature aging. UVB is still damaging as it has a shorter wavelength, causing sunburn which can
                    cause skin cancer. </p>


                <h3 class="blackfont">SPF/Broad Spectrum</h3>
                <p class="blackfont">Sunscreen can seem simple but, some people are confused by what SPF means on the
                    packaging as well as
                    broad spectrum. Some sunscreens have both while others have either or. SPF and broad spectrum both
                    measure the sunscreen's effectiveness. SPF measures how much protection is provided by the
                    sunscreen. SPF is associated with UVB therefore, it indicates the level of sunburn protection. Broad
                    spectrum helps protect against both forms of UV radiation so it's ideal to find a sunscreen that
                    provides SPF and broad spectrum. While it is more common to find suncreen with both elements, broad
                    spectrum's ingredients are expensive and harder to formulate, therefore, there are few products out
                    there without it.
