        <h2>About Orange Mushrooms</h2>
<p>

    <blockquote> The hygrophanous cap is 1 to 4 centimetres (0.39 to 1.57 in) in diameter,[4] and initially rounded or bell-shaped but becoming expanded and convex with age, often with a depression in the center.[5] The color is a bright orange that fades as the mushroom matures. The surface of the cap is sticky, especially in moist weather, and smooth, while the margin often has striations. The trama is soft, watery, and white. The gills are adnexed in attachment (gills narrowly attached/tapering toward stem so that their attachment is almost free), crowded together, and yellowish in color, with the color deepening to bright orange-red at the edges. The deepening in color at the edges is due to an orange pigment that is contained largely within cells called cheilocystidia. If handled, the yellow pigment will rub off and stain the skin.</blockquote>

<h3> Where Did The Name Come From?</h3>
<p>
    <blockquote> The species name, leaiana, honors Thomas Gibson Lea, a Cincinnati naturalist who contributed many fungal collections to the science of mycology.</blockquote>

<h3> Habitat and Distribution</h3>

<p>
    <blockquote>Mycena leaiana is a common species, and grows in dense cespitose clusters (with stipes sharing a single point of origin) on hardwood logs and branches. It is a North American species, and has been reported throughout the eastern and central U.S. and Canada. The variant Mycena leaiana var. australis can be found in Australia and New Zealand. </blockquote>
