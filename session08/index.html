			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Ladybugs are beneficial beetles known for their bright colors and spots, which warn predators they taste
			bad. They are also called ladybird beetles or lady beetles and have six legs, a hard shell for protection,
			and two sets of wings, with the hind wings used for flight. Ladybugs are harmless to humans and are valued
			by gardeners for eating pests like aphids. </p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Coccinellids range in size from 0.8 to 18 mm. Adult females tend to be slightly larger
				than males. They are generally oval with domed backs and flattened undersides. They have
				large
				compound eyes and clubbed antennae with seven to eleven segments. The powerful mandibles (equivalent
				to
				jaws) typically have pairs of "teeth" which face each other. The coccinellid prothorax (front of
				thorax) is broad and convex, and can cover the back of the head. Being beetles, they have
				hardened, non-overlapping forewings, known as elytra, which cover up the more fragile hindwings when
				the
				insects are not in flight. Their legs are relatively short, with a tarsal formula of 4-4-4 (may
				appear 3-3-3 because the third segment of each tarsus is reduced).The tarsus (end of leg) has
				two claws at the tip.</p>
